# GetSimple-PHPFived

The main goal of this plugin is to put in classes and constants all values and methods that are needed by the plugins.

This way I should be able to avoid all calls to "global" and make it clear where a method comes from.

I would love to see this -- or similar -- code integrated into the main GS code, and this is my way to test it and propose my ideas.
